<p>Who's tired of looking through HN with small, boring, hyperlinked titles? *insert crowd roaring*<p/>
<p>With this tiny little app you can swype through the links in a similar fashion to a popular dating app starting with the letter T<p/>
<p>Swype left to delete a card, right to add it to your instapaper account, and tap it to open it in the browser</p>
